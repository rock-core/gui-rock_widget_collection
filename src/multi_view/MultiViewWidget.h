/**
 * Widget which displays other widgets. All added widgets will be displayed as thumbnails
 * either left, right, on top or below one widget. Thumbnail Widgets can be clicked to show
 * in the main potion of the screen. S one widget will be the "active" widget which takes most of the
 * sapce within the widget all other widgets will be displayed as small widget in one of
 * the positions as mentioned above.<br>
 * If there are any changes to an added widget, the thumnail will blink in red. This
 * only works if the added widget has a notifyUpdate(int) signal. The signal will automatically
 * be taken into account via the qt meta object infrastructure. The currently selected widget
 * will be displayed with a name and is colorized in green to indicate selection.<br>
 * The size and orientation of the thumbnails can be configurede via the methods
 * setThumbnailPosition(int) and setThumnailSize(int, int).<br>
 * If the widget is too time consuming or can not be properly displayed when being small
 * one can either only show the widgets name or alternatively an icon.<br>
 * The widget will try to resize teh viewable center widget as large as it can. If this is not the desired
 *  behaviour setting a fixed or maximum size will work properly, so the widget will not stretch to
 * more than the given sizes.
